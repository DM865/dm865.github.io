## Exam Guidelines


The oral exam takes place on the 2nd of June.



The examination lasts approximately 25 minutes. Your goal is to
convince the examiners and external examiner ("censor" in Danish) that
you have a thorough understanding of the contents of the course.

You will be asked questions by the exmainers in a proportion of 2:1
between the approximation algorithms part and the projects. Aim for a
reasonably high pace and focus on the most interesting material
related to the question. You may bring a short list of keywords for
the exam to remember what you have decided to present. You are not
supposed to use note material, textbooks, transparencies, etc.

We, the examiners and the external examiner, will supplement with
additional questions when appropriate, and after a while, we will end
the discussion and move to a different part of the
curriculum. Finally, we will ask questions from your handed in
projects. Resuming:


* approx. 18 min questions on topics from the curriculum
* approx. 7 min discussion on the projects 

Note that some questions might be quite broad. Hence, you must select
the material you choose to cover. It is often a good idea to start
with an overview of the most important parts of a topic and then
give a detailed treatment of one result. You will of course also be
evaluated based on your selection of material. If you only present the
simplest material, you limit the grade you can obtain. On the other
hand, a good presentation of the simple material is better than a poor
presentation of the harder material.


## Details about the tools for the online setting

We will use Zoom. You will be given an address in due time.

It is student's responsability to have a working setup by the time of the exam and to have gain experience with the syestem.  

You must have the video active and the main camera should have focus on your face, that must always be visible online at anytime during the examination.
You might need to produce and show drawing and handwriting. For this, you should consider the solutions listed bewlo:


* Without additional hardware:

Tools: Smartphone with camera, computer, wireless LAN (Wi-Fi).

       * Using the app: **IP Webcam**. Install the app in the
         Smartphone. Start the App and press "Start server" (the last
         option in the main menu). When the camera starts you see an
         IP address, type that address in the browser of your
         computer. Share the screen of your computer via, eg, Zoom,
         thus you can share slides, yourself and your handwriting at
         once. Be creative in placing your smartphone in such a way
         that the camera can see your writings, see some inspiration
         below. It is possible to mirror, flip or rotate the image
         from the browser: select "Advanced settings" and then
         "Orientation" or "Mirror and Flip". An issue might be the
         battery consumption, so far neither of my two smartphones
         (old and new) could hold the two hours time of a lecture, but
         breaks are worth for doing the swap ;)


	* Using the app **Zoom**. Install the app in the
          Smartphone. Log in the zoom room of the conference, Use the
          camera of the smartphone to cast the handwriting. In
          comparison to the previous option it seems to consume less
          battery (the phone can in case be put in stand by) but it
          does not offer possibility to zoom in and pan as the option
          above.



* With additional hardware

** ExplainEverything with any marker, touch screen or tablet, eventually also the track pad could be enough.
